<p>Obedience cues such as sit, down, and stay are very important when it comes to having a happy, healthy relationship with your dog. The most important thing in a relationship is trust - and when you know you can trust your dog to come when called, or stay when told, it becomes easier to trust your dog in public spaces, or off-leash, or at the dog park!</p>
<p>The single most important thing in training is consistency. If you want your dog to do something specific when you say something specific - you have to enforce and reinforce whatever it is you want them to do. Enforcing can look like not moving forward when your dog hits the end of the leash, using leash pressure to keep them on a bed for a place/stay, not giving a reward until they do what you've asked them to do, using your body to make sure the dog does what you asked them to do, or anything else that ensure the dog follows through with whatever it was you wanted them to do in the first place. Reinforcing is using rewards in response to behavior we want to continue or increase in frequency. Rewards can be food, play, attention, or simply moving towards something your dog wants to see or interact with. Luring, prompting, shaping, and responding to pressure are all ways we can teach our dogs to do whatever it is we want them to do. We can use food, toys, leashes, and many other tools in training, but the only thing that matters is if you are using those tools in a consistent way.</p>
<p>Dogs, especially herding breed dogs, absolutely thrive on routine and predictability. This doesn't mean breakfast always has to be at 7am - but it does mean that your morning routine should look more or less the same no matter what time it is. You don't always have to make your dog sit before you give them their dinner/breakfast, but if that's something you want them to do you should ask for it every single time.</p>
<p>Service dog tasks are taught very very similarly to obedience cues, but the cues are often non-verbal and require a very strong bond between the dog and the person they are helping. Service dogs can learn to do just about anything that can help make your life easier - they can help you move easier, retrieve things for you, alert you to potential medical episodes, or respond to medical episodes to shorten them or make them less severe. If you want your dog to be a service dog, make sure you know what tasks you need them to do first - a small dog can't pull you along or do mobility tasks, and extremely large dogs take longer to train, have extra costs regarding food and veterinary care, and may not be able to work for as many years as a smaller dog can.</p>
