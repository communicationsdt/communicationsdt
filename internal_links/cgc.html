<p>Do you want your dog to be successful in public spaces? Do your goals include going to dog friendly breweries/restaurant patios? Public access training is for more than just service dogs and therapy dogs - it's for any dog that spends a decent amount of time in public parks, on city streets, or in other spaces where they're likely to encounter things like kids, bikes, cars, and strangers.</p>
<p>The AKC Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test items can be a great place to start when it comes to public access training. Loose-leash walking in particular is the most important skill a dog needs to know in order to behave successfully in public - if your dog is pulling, they definitely aren't listening!</p>
<p>Settling in a down position for an extended period of time is also extremely important for public access training. Asking your dog to sit or lie down and simply watch the world go by can show them very quickly that they don't need to react or respond to every single person or dog that crosses their path - simply staying in one place will get them all they want and more.</p>
<p>Loose leash walking is possibly the most important skill a dog can learn in order to behave in a calm stable manner in public. If the dog is able to remain aware of leash pressure and actively keep themself from hitting the end of their leash, they're very likely in a state of mind where they can make good choices and keep themself and you safe.</p>
<p>As a certified AKC Canine Good Citizen evaluator, I am able to guide you and your dog through the requirements for regular CGC, urban CGC, and advanced CGC. If your goals include service work or therapy work, passing the CGC test is a good place to start.</p>
<p>The CGC test consists of the following ten criteria, all evaluated on a pass/fail basis:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Accepting a Friendly Stranger</li>
	<li>Sitting Politely for Petting</li>
	<li>Appearance + Grooming</li>
	<li>Loose Leash Walking</li>
	<li>Walking Through a Crowd</li>
	<li>Sit + Down on Cue, Stay in Place</li>
	<li>Come When Called</li>
	<li>Dog Distraction</li>
	<li>Noise Distraction</li>
	<li>Supervised Seperation (3 Minutes)</li>
</ol>

<p>The CGC test is not going to make or break your public access training, but it is a good starting place to understand the skills your dog needs to have in order to navigate public spaces in a polite manner. Not only should your dog be able to walk nicely on a loose leash no matter how short that leash is, they should also be able to follow you when you walk around other people or objects. They should be able to tolerate being touched by strangers, and should be able to focus on you while strangers are touching them. Your dog doesn't have to be perfect - it's okay to catch a quick drive by sniff, or check out something noisy happening around them. But they should know how to remain calm and composed in a variety of situations if you want your dog to be successful in public spaces.</p>
