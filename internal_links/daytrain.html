<p>One option for training is day training, where your dog can spend some dedicated one on one time with a qualified trainer 3 times per week, and you get a bonus session every two weeks to go over what your dog has been learning.</p>
<p>This option gets you many of the benefits of a board and train without the high cost, or having to spend weeks away from your dog! Your dog will still live at your home, but will spend multiple hours a week practicing skills and learning obedience cues.</p>
<p>This is a really great option for people who are unable to get out and do the training their dog needs, whether that's due to a busy life, an illness/injury, or any other reason. Day training can also be used to help your dog generalize what they've learned, if you have a hard time getting into public spaces on a regular basis, day training can help your dog get the experience you aren't able to give them.</p>
<p>Day training can also be useful when it comes to service dog and therapy dog training. The more public access practice your dog gets, the more solid they will be in public spaces. Day training also means your dog can get sessions dedicated to tasking practice, as well as public access practice.</p>
<p>Reactive dogs can also benefit heavily from multiple training sessions a week. The more often they are asked to display calm behavior in a structured setting, the more often they will offer calm behavior in less structured settings.</p>
