<p>Your dog spends most of their life in your home, and that's where most of their training takes place whether you're intending it to or not! Every time you pet your dog, feed your dog, talk to your dog, you're participating in training. What are you teaching them? Are they making choices you like, or are they making choices you'd prefer they didn't? Everytime you respond, or don't respond, to a dog's choice, you're letting them know how you feel about that choice.</p>
<p>Sometimes we can't be there to directly respond to the choices our dogs make. These are often times when a crate, playpen, or tie-back can be utilized to help our dogs not make choices that could harm them or create undesirable situations. The trash can knocked over is a travesty for you - but a haven of scents and tastes for your dog. Not only do we have to teach our dogs what we want them to do, we have to keep them from doing the things we don't want them to do. Practice makes performance - if your dog is practicing making messes, that's what they'll continue to do! If they're practicing lying quietly while you leave the room, that's the choice they're likely to make in the future. This is called <i>management</i>, and is a very very important part of training, whether obedience or behavior modification are our primary goals.</p>
<p>Generalizing and proofing are the last steps of training - first you should always familiarize your dog with concepts by starting your training in or around your home, or in a quiet familiar place that doesn't have too many distractions. With particularly sensitive dogs, it can be good to do all of your training in one area of the house to start - sometimes that means restricting your dog's movements, or lowering expectations of their behavior in other areas of the home for a little bit. In order for dogs to learn, you have to teach them context-by-context. Dogs understand very quickly that consequences differ depending on whether they're on leash or off leash, and they quickly learn that rewards differ depending on what you're holding in your hand! By controlling the external variables as much as possible, we can generalize our dogs to different contexts in a step-by-step way.</p>
<p>Most of the time in-home training is scheduled once a week, once every two weeks, or once every three weeks, depending on your needs and your dog's needs. If your dog needs professional training more often than once a week, take a look at the day training option!</p>
